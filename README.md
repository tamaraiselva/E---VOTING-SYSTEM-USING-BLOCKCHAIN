# E---VOTING-SYSTEM-USING-BLOCKCHAIN
Electronic voting or e-voting has been used in varying forms since the 1970s with fundamental benefits over paper-based systems such as increased efficiency and reduced errors However, there remain challenges to achieving widespread adoption of such systems especially with respect to improving their resilience against potential faules Block-cham is a disruptive technology of the comment era and promises to improve the overall resilience of e-voting systems This paper presents an effort to leverage the benefits of blockchain such as cryptographs foundations and transparency to achieve an effective scheme for voting: The proposed scheme conforms to the fundamental requirements for e-voting schemes and achieves end-to-end venerability The paper presents details of the proposed e-voting scheme along with its implementation using the Malti chain platform. The paper presents an in-depth evaluation of the scheme which successfully demonstrates in effectiveness achieving an end-to-end verifiable e-voting scheme
